Priority queue is basically a queue which satisfies two important properties
1. Complete Binary Tree(CBT)
2. Max HEAP/ MIN HEAP

MAX HEAP -  A Binary tree in which the nodes priority is always greater than the priority of its children.
MIN HEAP - A Binary tree in which the nodes pririty is always less than the priority of its children.

Complete Binary Tree - It is a binary tree in which nodes are filled levelwise
